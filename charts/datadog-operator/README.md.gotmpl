## How to configure which namespaces are watched by the Operator.

By default, the Operator only watches resources (`DatadogAgent`, `DatadogMonitor`) that are present in the same namespace.

It is possible to configure the Operator to watch resources that are present in one or several specific namespaces.

```yaml
watchNamespaces:
- "default"
- "datadog"
```

To watch all namespaces, the following configuration needs to be used:

```yaml
watchNamespaces:
- ""
```
