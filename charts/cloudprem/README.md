# CloudPrem

![Version: v0.1.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-v0.1.1-informational?style=flat-square) ![Type: application](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-application-informational?style=flat-square) ![AppVersion: v0.1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/AppVersion-v0.1.0-informational?style=flat-square)

## Using the Datadog Helm repository

Add and update the Datadog Helm repository to your Helm repositories:

```sh
helm repo add datadog https://helm.datadoghq.com
helm repo update
```

## Prerequisites

- AWS account
- Kubernetes `1.25+` ([EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) preferred)
- [AWS Load Balancer Controller](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller)
- PostgreSQL database ([RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) preferred)
- S3 bucket

## Quick start

### Creating the Kubernetes namespace

```sh
kubectl create namespace <namespace name>
```

### Storing the PostgreSQL database connection string as a Kubernetes secret

```sh
kubectl create secret generic <secret name> --from-literal QW_METASTORE_URI=postgres://<username>:<password>@<endpoint>:<port>/<database> -n <namespace name>
```

### Customizing the Helm chart

Create a `datadog-values.yaml` file to override the default values with your custom configuration. This is where you define environment-specific settings such as the image tag, AWS account ID, service account, ingress setup, resource requests and limits, and more.
Any parameters not explicitly overridden in `datadog-values.yaml` will fall back to the defaults defined in the chartâ€™s `values.yaml`. Here is an example of a `datadog-values.yaml` file with such overrides:

```yaml
aws:
  accountId: "123456789012"

# Environment variables
# Any environment variables defined here will be available to all pods in the deployment
environment:
  AWS_REGION: us-east-1

# Service account configuration
# If `serviceAccount.create` is set to `true`, a service account will be created with the specified name.
# The service account will be annotated with the IAM role ARN if `aws.accountId` and serviceAccount.eksRoleName` are set.
# Additional annotations can be added using serviceAccount.extraAnnotations.
serviceAccount:
  create: true
  name: cloudprem
  # The name of the IAM role to use for the service account. If set, the following annotations will be added to the service account:
  # - eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::<aws.accountId>:role/<serviceAccount.eksRoleName>
  # - eks.amazonaws.com/sts-regional-endpoints: "true"
  eksRoleName: cloudprem
  extraAnnotations: {}

# CloudPrem node configuration
config:
  # The root URI where index data will be stored. This should be an S3 path.
  # All indexes created in CloudPrem will be stored under this location.
  default_index_root_uri: s3://<bucket name>/indexes

# Ingress configuration
# The chart supports two ingress configurations:
# 1. A public ingress for external access via the internet that will be used exclusively by Datadog's controle plane and query service.
# 2. An internal ingress for access within the VPC
#
# Both ingresses will provision Application Load Balancers (ALBs) in AWS.
# The public ingress ALB will be created in public subnets.
# The internal ingress ALB will be created in private subnets.
#
# Additional annotations can be added to customize the ALB behavior.
ingress:
  # The public ingress is configured to only accept TLS traffic and requires mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication.
  # Datadog's control plane and query service authenticate themselves using client certificates,
  # ensuring that only authorized Datadog services can access CloudPrem nodes through the public ingress.
  public:
    enabled: true
    name: cloudprem-public
    host: cloudprem.acme.corp
    extraAnnotations:
      alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/load-balancer-name: cloudprem-public

  # The internal ingress is used by Datadog agents and other collectors running outside
  # the Kubernetes cluster to send their logs to CloudPrem.
  internal:
    enabled: true
    name: cloudprem-internal
    host: cloudprem.acme.internal
    extraAnnotations:
      alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/load-balancer-name: cloudprem-internal

# Metastore configuration
# The metastore is responsible for storing and managing index metadata.
# It requires a PostgreSQL database connection string to be provided via a Kubernetes secret.
# The secret should contain a key named `QW_METASTORE_URI` with a value in the format:
# postgresql://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>
#
# The metastore connection string is mounted into the pods using extraEnvFrom to reference the secret.
metastore:
  extraEnvFrom:
    - secretRef:
        name: cloudprem-metastore-uri

# Indexer configuration
# The indexer is responsible for processing and indexing incoming data it receives data from various sources (e.g., Datadog agents, log collectors)
# and transforms it into searchable files called "splits" stored in S3.
#
# The indexer is horizontally scalable - you can increase `replicaCount` to handle higher indexing throughput.
# Resource requests and limits should be tuned based on your indexing workload.
#
# The default values are suitable for moderate indexing loads of up to 20MB/s per indexer pod.
indexer:
  replicaCount: 2

  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: "4"
      memory: "8Gi"
    limits:
      cpu: "4"
      memory: "8Gi"

# Searcher configuration
# The searcher is responsible for executing search queries against the indexed data stored in S3.
# It handles search requests from Datadog's query service and returns matching results.
#
# The searcher is horizontally scalable - you can increase `replicaCount` to handle more concurrent searches.
# Resource requirements for searchers are highly workload-dependent and should be determined empirically.
# Key factors that impact searcher performance include:
# - Query complexity (e.g., number of terms, use of wildcards or regex)
# - Query concurrency (number of simultaneous searches)
# - Amount of data scanned per query
# - Data access patterns (cache hit rates)
#
# Memory is particularly important for searchers as they cache frequently accessed index data in memory.
# Monitor searcher metrics and adjust resources based on observed performance and workload characteristics.
searcher:
  replicaCount: 2

  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: "4"
      memory: "16Gi"
    limits:
      cpu: "4"
      memory: "16Gi"
```

### Installing or upgrading the Helm chart

```sh
helm upgrade --install <release name> datadog/cloudprem \
  -n <namespace name> \
  -f datadog-values.yaml
```

### Uninstalling the Helm chart
To uninstall the deployment:

```sh
helm uninstall <release name>
```

This command removes all the Kubernetes resources associated with the chart and deletes the release.
